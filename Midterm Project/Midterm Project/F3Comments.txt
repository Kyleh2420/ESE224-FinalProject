Your bones get tangled up in the vines to your left. Damn it!
The heat here feels different than hell. It feels more... Relaxing.
A bug drones past your ear.
You hear slight movement of critters below the ground.
You hear the mating calls of birds in the air.
You stepped in a puddle. You could feel it!
You brush past a tree on your left.
You brush past a dead tree on your left and get caught on it. Stuggling, you tear the tree apart.
The air here smells fresher than it did back where you came from.
How did it get to this point?
You slipped on the mossy rocks below.
River flows in you.
You encounter a fast flowing river, and decide to take a swim. Little fishies get caught in your ribcage. Dinner!
A pinecone smacks your face.
A woody smell fills the air around you.
Is that...? Home? A glimmer of hope flows through your bones.
A wolf howls in the distance.
Dew drops form on your skull. You brush it off.
The sky looks a little gray today.
Rain starts falling from the sky.
