Worms wiggle under your skele-bones.
You stop to rest on a gem. It got stuck in your pelvis.
The more you walk, the more gems you find wedged between your toes.
You walk into a cave all you see is dark. 
Out of the corner of your eye, you see a dung beetle come out of home its made in a rock.
You walk pass a scarecrow but it isn't scary.
You see a pile of gems. It was just a dream.
Swords are everywhere but there is only one that will help you succeed. 
Cats will morph into dogs but the dogs cannot morph back.
Skele skele skele dance on the road when you are bored.
Your only wish is to be back on earth but what will it cost?
Earth where the beds are comfy.
Boney jones help me out.
Your skelly bones ache but there's nothing that can be done.
Nothing to eat on the road except for dirt.
You find some bone lotion.
