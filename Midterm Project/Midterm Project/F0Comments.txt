The fiery streams of hellfire roar over where your ears used to be.
Some crumbling rocks drop into the hellfire, sparking flames. 
Flames geysers rocket into the dark and infinite ceiling, illuminating it for a few seconds. 
The smell of burning flesh fills your nostrils, crippling you in your steps.
You feel fingers of hair brush through your feet. 
How the hell do you eat anything if you don't have a stomach? Panicking, you gag.
You recall the last moments of your life, embraced by loved ones and a furry life companion. 
Can't have muscle aches if you don't have muscles, so keep going!
All those years spent trying to lower your body fat percentage when all you had to do was visit Hell to get 0%.
To the left, you hear screaming. To your right you hear screaming. You start screaming.
You splash into a glowing red puddle. Strange. You didn't feel anything.
The air tasted... Roasted.
They told you hell was hot. You don't feel anything though. Liars!
Is that... Bacon cooking?
The smell of sulfur hits your sinuses.
Your eyes burn.
Little specs of snow? No, ashes fall from the ceiling.
Pieces of ash fall into your eyes, stinging them.
A shadow whips by the right side of your vision. What was that?
A loud groan echos from the distance.
Cats meow loudly in the distance.
