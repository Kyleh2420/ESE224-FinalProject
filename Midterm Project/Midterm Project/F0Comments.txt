The fiery streams of hellfire roar over where your ears used to be.
Some crumbling rocks drop into the hellfire, sparking flames. 
Flames geysers rocket into the dark and infinite ceiling, illuminating it for a few seconds. 
(too morbid??) The smell of burning flesh fills your nostrils, crippling you in your steps.
You feel fingers of hair brush through your feet. 
How the hell do you eat anything if you don't have a stomach? Panicking, you gag.
You recall the last moments of your life, embraced by loved ones and a furry life companion. 
Can't have muscle aches if you don't have muscles, so keep going!
All those years spent trying to lower your body fat percentage when sll you had to do was visit Hell to get 0%.
