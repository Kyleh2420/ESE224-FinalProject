The ground feels funny. You look down and see funny pokey things. If memory serves correct, these are called staglmites.
You hear water dripping from the distance. Drip. Drip. Drip.
The smell of mildew hangs in the air.
voive echos
the cry of bats
Mystical tingles fill the air.
You hear a ringing getting louder and louder.
The crystals beneath crack below your feet.
You hear a gem shatter in the distance.
Your are blinded by the various crystals on the wall. Purple, blue, green, red... So many different colors!
Is that a rainbow on the wall?
You feel like you're wrapped in a warm blanket by a spirit. 
If you were human, this cave would be a gold - no, a gem mine!
