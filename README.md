You are ________, a skeleton who has been condemned to the depths of hell. However, hell just isn't to your satisfaction, so you're escaping back to earth. Explore the path, defeat enemies, collect organs, and set yourself up to become a real person again. Succeed, and live a life of comfort back on earth. Fail, and become an uncessful ghost, forever stuck in the land of inbetween, neither satisfied on hell or reborn on earth. Succeed, and you're reborn on earth as a brand new being.
